# 🥤 The Energy Drink Escapade

A two-year university project born out of poor decisions and an inexplicable need to document them.

Me and my roommate ranked every energy drink we got our hands on: solo, mixed with each other, mixed with things that should never have been mixed. Scores are averaged between the two of us on a 1–10 scale.

**Most of this was recorded through 2022 and into early 2023.** After gradution, the sessions kind of stopped, so this is a snapshot of that era.
